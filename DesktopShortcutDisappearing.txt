If this is happening, 

turn off Computer Maintenance:
	Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
	Under System and Security, click Find and fix problems.
	On the left navigation pane, click Change settings.
	Set Computer Maintenance to Off.

If that doesn’t work then also go to c:\windows\Diagnostics\Scheduled\Maintenance\ and delete TS_UnusedDesktopIcons.ps1
