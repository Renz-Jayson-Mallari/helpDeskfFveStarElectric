If increasing network bandwidth is not an option, you can increase the amount of time the program waits for a response from the license manager by configuring an environment variable at the client workstation. Follow these steps:
1.	Right-click My Computer. Click Properties. For Windows 7, click the "Advanced system settings" link.
2.	In the System Properties dialog box, click the "Advanced" tab.
3.	On the Advanced tab, click "Environment Variablesâ€¦".
4.	In the Environment Variables dialog box, under System Variables, click New.
5.	In the New System Variable dialog box, enter FLEXLM_TIMEOUT for the variable name and 10000000 for the variable value.
6.	Click OK to close each dialog box.
7.	Launch the Autodesk application.
If you are able to obtain a license, the value of 1000000 microseconds (1 second) is sufficient. If you still cannot obtain a license, repeat the procedure; increasing the value in 1000000 microsecond increments until you are able to obtain a license from the license server.

Note: You may also need to specify TCP port 2080 in your Autodesk software client license file, LICPATH.lic.
