Subject: Issues at 425 Park connecting

Sorry but we are having trouble connecting to the Citrix to enter time JDE and exchange server for email.

We can get internet however curiously.  So chrome works.

Via the hotspot the exchange and JDE works so we are switching back and forth on that.


Can you help have a look?
