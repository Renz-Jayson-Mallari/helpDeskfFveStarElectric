Printer Duplex to Single Sided

This printer prints only 11x17 in double sided.  I think it’s an automatic setting and cannot be adjusted. 

So all my 11x17’s require me to use the 3503 color printer if I want to print a single sided only package of dwgs

Can you adjust that setting on the 4002 to print 11x17’s in a package as single sided? 

I assume this would be helpful for everyone here.
